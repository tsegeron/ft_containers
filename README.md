# ft_containers 42
### C++ containers, easy mode (c++98 std)

The goal of the project is to reimplement 4 STL containers with normal and reverse iterators (except stack ofc):
1. stack (based on vector)
2. vector
3. set
4. map

&nbsp;


In addition some utils should've been provided:
- iterators_traits
- reverse_iterator
- enable_if
- is_integral
- equal, lexicographical_compare
- pair, make_pair

> It was required to implement a Red-Black Tree and use it in Map and Set containers.

> Custom containers' performance/timing allowed to be up to 20 times slower than original. Mine turned out to be 2 times slower in general.
